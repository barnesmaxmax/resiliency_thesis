 I would like to first thank the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) for
 their invaluable support throughout this research experience. Special thanks
 goes to the Technical Advisory Committee, especially Reuel Alder and Andrea
 Moser for their support throughout the development of this project as well.

 I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to my Advisor, Dr. Gregory
 S. Macfarlane, for the many hours spent in meetings, hundreds -- if not thousands
 -- of responses to questions I've sent him at all hours of the day or night, and
 for the hours spent guiding me through the development of a logit-based choice
 model. I acknowledge and thank Dr. Macfarlane for his support and role in my
 schooling and professional development.

A huge thank you to the professors on my graduate committee, Dr. Grant G.
Schultz and Dr. Daniel P. Ames for their efforts in this project as well. I
would also like to express my thanks to each of the other professors I have
had the privilege to learn from throughout my schooling.

 I am also extremely grateful for and cannot begin to express my thanks to
 Natalie Gray. Her tireless efforts conducting research and helping with
 data management and visualization throughout this project have been invaluable. Needless to say,
 I would have been a disorganized mess throughout all of my graduate experience
 without her help. I would like to extend my support and best wishes to her as
 she begins her own graduate project which is heavily based on the research we have done
 together over the past few years. Good luck!

I would like to also extend my sincere thanks to my family and friends who have
supported me throughout my schooling. I could not have accomplished any of this
without the support of my parents, Mark and Wendy Barnes. I would also like to
thank my extended family for their advice and support throughout my time in
school. I thank my friends, Janessa James, Evan and Sydney Smith, Logan Bennett,
Sami Lau, Christian Lundskog, Chris Day, Eric Anderson, and Jessica Kuehn for
their invaluable friendship, for their support in making this stressful time
less stressful, and for helping me to succeed in my goals and life endeavors thus far.
