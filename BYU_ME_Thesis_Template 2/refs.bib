  Comments:
    This paper uses Lyapunov analysis to show stability for a simple
                  nonlinear model of phase lock loops with zero noise,
                  step inputs, and 1st and 2nd order low pass
                  filters.  It should be fairly easy to extend this
                  paper to more general low pass filters and also to
                  improve the design using the satisficing approach.

The paper relates how vulnerability related problems have been addressed so far, current developments and finally what the future should hold in order to provide us with the comprehensive network analysis tool that our complex society calls for.}

abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual’s expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).}

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.}

abstract = {We examine the accessibility benefits associated with some land-use policy strategies for the Netherlands that anticipate on expected climate change. A disaggregate logsum accessibility measure using the Dutch national land-use/transport interaction model TIGRIS XL is used to compute changes in consumer surplus. The measure provides an elegant and convenient solution to measure the full accessibility benefits from land-use and/or transport policies, when discrete choice travel-demand models are available that already produce logsums. It accounts for both changes in generalised transport costs and changes in destination utility, and is thus capable of providing the accessibility benefits from changes in the distribution of activities, due to transport or land-use policies. The case study shows that logsum accessibility benefits from land-use policy strategies can be quite large compared to investment programmes for road and public transport infrastructure, largely due to changes in trip production and destination utility, which are not measured in the standard rule-of-half benefit measure.}

But the concept of accessibility has rarely been translated into performance measures by which policies are evaluated, despite a substantial literature on the concept. This paper is an attempt to bridge the gap between the academic literature and the practical application of such measures and provide a framework for the development of accessibility measures. Issues that planners must address in developing an accessibility measure are outlined, and two case studies suggestive of the range of possible approaches are presented. }

    abstract = { A complex network analysis methodology was adopted to evaluate structural resilience in surface transportation networks with the use of examples of the U.S. highway and Interstate networks in Connecticut and the Indiana interurban railroad network. Resilience in these networks was evaluated alongside that of a biological network, which through millions of years of evolution had developed an adaptive behavior in which cost, efficiency, and resilience were optimized in the feeding network that was constructed. Disruptions in the networks were simulated by using link-based targeted and random strategies. With simulation results, network performance under disruption was assessed by using two metrics: global efficiency and the relative size of the giant component for each disruption strategy. The biological network exhibits superior resistance to disruption regardless of strategy, a quality attributed to its redundant and cyclic weblike network structure and its innate ability to adapt to disruptions by developing network structures that have been honed through millions of years of evolution. In addition, linear correlations between network structural metrics such as the average degree, density, and average clustering coefficient were explored and analyzed. }

abstract = {We address a pre-disaster planning problem that seeks to strengthen a highway network whose links are subject to random failures due to a disaster. Each link may be either operational or non-functional after the disaster. The link failure probabilities are assumed to be known a priori, and investment decreases the likelihood of failure. The planning problem seeks connectivity for first responders between various origin–destination (O–D) pairs and hence focuses on uncapacitated road conditions. The decision-maker's goal is to select the links to invest in under a limited budget with the objective of maximizing the post-disaster connectivity and minimizing traversal costs between the origin and destination nodes. The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program in which the investment decisions in the first stage alter the survival probabilities of the corresponding links. We restructure the objective function into a monotonic non-increasing multilinear function and show that using the first order terms of this function leads to a knapsack problem whose solution is a local optimum to the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world data related to strengthening Istanbul's urban highway system against earthquake risk illustrate the tractability of the method and provide practical insights for decision-makers.}

    abstract = { Every day dependence on transportation grows as local, regional, national, and international independence increases. Resilient transportation systems are needed to secure the highest possible level of service during disruptive events, including natural disasters and those caused by humans. To prepare for these events, decision makers need guidance to determine what investments are likely to improve the resiliency of their networks, which are often hampered by limited resources. To date, such guidance has been primarily qualitative. This paper presents a methodology to quantify resiliency, under preevent conditions, by use of a fuzzy inference approach. This methodology expands on previous work by the authors and others, by refining the definitions of key variables, adjusting model interactions, and increasing transparency between metrics. The paper includes a case study in which the methodology is applied to a disruptive event in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The case study illustrates the methodology's ability to (a) evaluate the extent to which the Dominican Republic's transportation network is prepared for a disruptive event, (b) help select investments that have the potential to increase the resiliency of the network, and (c) provide outputs that will support a variety of current economic analysis strategies, allow comparison of different investment scenarios, and facilitate decision making. The paper concludes with a sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of alternative investments on the network. }

abstract = { Transport user benefits are of great importance in cost–benefit analysis when transport projects are appraised. Generally, these benefits have the greatest effect on the results of cost–benefit analyses. It is common to adopt the consumer surplus for calculating transport user benefits. The consumer surplus measure is based on the underlying demand model and follows from the integration of the demand curve. If the popular logit model is used for forecasting travel demand, a consumer surplus measure takes a closed form that is easy to calculate. Furthermore, in cost–benefit analyses the change in consumer surplus between an initial and final state is needed; the change can be easily derived by the difference of the logsums of the two states. This logsum approach is proven and correct for travel demand models based on the logit model without multiple constraints. However, for travel demand models dealing with two or more sets of constraints, the logsum approach fails. In this paper, a mathematical approach is described for a transport user benefits measure that corresponds to the consumer surplus and is universal for all travel demand models with constraints. The measure for a doubly constrained trip distribution is derived. The applicability of the derived approach is shown by a simple example. }

In this paper, we develop two network-based measures for systematically characterizing the redundancy of transportation networks: travel alternative diversity and network spare capacity. Specifically, the travel alternative diversity dimension is to evaluate the existence of multiple modes and effective routes available for travelers or the number of effective connections between a specific origin-destination pair. The network spare capacity dimension is to quantify the network-wide residual capacity with an explicit consideration of travelers’ mode and route choice behaviors as well as congestion effect. They can address two fundamental questions in the pre-disaster transportation system evaluation and planning, i.e., “how many effective redundant alternatives are there for travelers in the event of a disruption?” and “how much redundant capacity does the network have?” To implement the two measures in practice, computational methods are provided to evaluate the network redundancy. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the features of the two redundancy measures as well as the applicability of the computational methods. The analysis results reveal that the two measures have different characterizations on network redundancy from different perspectives, and they can complement each other by providing meaningful information to both travelers and planners.}

In this study, we propose a resilience-based framework for mitigating risk to surface road transportation networks. We utilize recent developments in modern network theory to introduce a novel metric based on system reliability and network connectivity to measure resilience-based performance of a road transportation network. The formulation of this resilience-based performance metric (referred in the paper as WIPW), systematically integrates the network topology, redundancy level, traffic patterns, structural reliability of network components (i.e. roads and bridge) and functionality of the network during community’s post-disaster recovery, and permits risk mitigation alternatives for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common basis. Using the WIPW as a network performance metric, we propose a project ranking mechanism for identifying and prioritizing transportation network retrofit projects that are critical for effective pre-disaster risk mitigation and resilience planning. We further present a decision methodology to select optimal solutions among possible alternatives of new construction, which offer opportunities to improve the resilience of the network by altering its existing topology. Finally, we conclude with an illustration that uses the WIPW as the performance metric to support risk-based mitigation decisions using a hypothetical bridge network susceptible to seismic hazards.}

Among the most common in the context of transportation systems are the grid, ring, hub-and-spoke, complete, scale-free and small-world networks. This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the topology’s characteristics, in a transportation system’s ability to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that the topological attributes of a transportation system significantly affect its resilience to disaster events. Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network structures with some relation to transportation system layout. Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput, connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and conversely identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems.}

It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.}

While traditional measures of link importance capture a link's role for transport efficiency under normal conditions, we are interested in a link's role for transport robustness and network redundancy. We refer to this concept as redundancy importance and introduce two measures based on traffic flow and disruption impacts (here operationalized as travel delay), respectively. In the flow-based measure we consider the net traffic flow that is redirected to the studied link when other links are closed. In the impact-based measure we also consider the impact that is avoided through the studied link, i.e., how much worse the next-best backup alternatives would be if the studied link itself would not be available. We argue that although a link may not be important under normal conditions, a higher prioritization in resource allocations could be justified if many users could come to rely on it in extraordinary situations. Hence, these measures should be useful as quantitative decision support in the allocation of resources for investments and maintenance as well as for setting up pre-emptive rerouting plans. The measures are applied in a case study of northern Sweden and the general characteristics that determine which links are redundancy important are identified.},

The proposed solution method is a path-based partial linearization algorithm to approximately solve the restricted CDA-PCL-SUE. The proposed algorithm is a three-phase iterative process. Phase 1 is an entropy maximization problem on O-D flow space that can be solved by Bregman's balancing algorithm. Phase 2 is a PCL SUE problem that can be solved by PCL formula.

The proposed algorithms with the six line search methods, namely, golden section (GS), bisection (BS), Armijo's rule (AR), method of successive averages (MSA), self-regulated averaging (SRA) scheme, and quadratic interpolation (QI) scheme, are compared in terms of various convergence characteristics: root mean square error, step size, KKT-based mean square error and objective function. In terms of computational efficiency, under different path set sizes, dispersion parameters, impedance parameters and demand levels, the following line search methods are ordered from best to worst: SRA, GS, AR, QI, BS and MSA. The performances of Armijo's rule and QI have greater variances. The performance of QI is worse with the increase of the path set size. Given all other factors being the same, the increase of dispersion parameter, path set size or demand level yields the increase of CPU time, whereas the change of impedance parameter does not influence CPU time.

The proposed measure is time-dependent and it estimates the realisation of the travel impedance by the community of passengers for travelling between an origin-destination (OD) pair. The main advantage of the developed measure, as compared to the existing transit impedance measures, relates to its capability in capturing the diversity benefit that the transit systems may offer the society of travellers with different traveling preferences. To clarify the necessity of such capability, we demonstrate the randomness (subjectivity) of travel impedance perceived by transit passengers, through evidence from the observed path choices made in the transit network of the greater Brisbane metropolitan region in Australia. The proposed impedance measure is basically a nested logit "logsum" composition over a generated set of reasonable path options whose systematic utilities are evaluated based on a discrete choice model previously developed and calibrated for the greater Brisbane transit passengers. As a case study, the proposed impedance measure is calculated for all the origin blocks in the Brisbane area, during the morning commutes to the Central Business District (CBD). The results are presented and discussed, and intuitive and important advantages are demonstrated for the proposed measure.},

abstract = {Although various approaches have been proposed for modeling day-to-day traffic flow evolution, none of them, to the best of our knowledge, have been validated for disrupted networks due to the lack of empirical observations. By carefully studying the driving behavioral changes after the collapse of I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, we found that most of the existing day-to-day traffic assignment models would not be suitable for modeling the traffic evolution under network disruption, because they assume that drivers' travel cost perception depends solely on their experiences from previous days. When a significant network change occurs unexpectedly, travelers' past experience on a traffic network may not be entirely useful because the unexpected network change could disturb the traffic greatly. To remedy this, in this paper, we propose a prediction-correction model to describe the traffic equilibration process. A " predicted" flow pattern is constructed inside the model to accommodate the imperfect perception of congestion that is gradually corrected by actual travel experiences. We also prove rigorously that, under mild assumptions, the proposed prediction-correction process has the user equilibrium flow as a globally attractive point. The proposed model is calibrated and validated with the field data collected after the collapse of I-35W Bridge. This study bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical applications of day-to-day traffic equilibration approaches and furthers the understanding of traffic equilibration process after network disruption. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Infrastructure vulnerability is a topic of rising interest in the scientific literature for both the general increase of unexpected events and the strategic importance of certain links. Protective investments are extremely costly and risks are distributed in space and time, which poses important decision problems to the public sector decision makers.In an economic prospective, the evaluation of infrastructure vulnerability is oriented on the estimation of direct and indirect costs of hazards. Although the estimation of direct costs is straightforward, the evaluation of indirect cost involves factors non-directly observable making the approximation a difficult issue. This paper provides an estimate of the indirect costs caused by a two weeks closure of the north-south Gotthard road corridor, one of the most important infrastructure links in Europe, and implements a cost-benefit analysis tool that allows the evaluation of measures ensuring a full protection along the corridor. The identification of the indirect cost relies on the generalized cost estimation, which parameters come from two stated preference experiments, the first based on actual condition whereas the second assumes a road closure. The procedure outlined in this paper proposes a methodology aimed to identify and quantify the economic vulnerability associated with a road transport infrastructure and, to evaluate the economic and social efficiency of a vulnerability reduction by the consideration of protective measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wisetjindawat2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. Transport resilience is an important area of research in the global effort to adapt to climate change. This paper introduces and applies a stochastic modeling methodology to assess the impact of multihazard events. Most cities are exposed to multiple types of extreme events, sometimes simultaneously, and focusing on single events may lead to inadequate design recommendations. By assigning failure probabilities of road segments and by estimating road failure through Monte Carlo simulation, roads and areas that are particularly vulnerable to multihazard events can be detected. The performance of the large-scale road network of the Tokai region in Japan (prone to both typhoons and earthquakes) is analyzed by considering three scenarios of hazards: flash flood, earthquake, and the combination of both hazards. The model considers two key traffic performance characteristics: postdisaster reduced road capacity and hourly variations in travel demand. Overall, several areas in the region are found to be currently severely at risk, thus providing direct information that can help authorities test the effectiveness of future road infrastructure projects.},

@article{Du2017,
abstract = {In transportation planning works, critical links identification is helpful to evaluate the vulnerable parts of the designed network schemes. A new capacity-based network robustness index is presented for identifying critical links and evaluating the transportation system performance. It uses the change of the total network capacity as an evaluation measure. The advanced practical network capacity model is employed to estimate the throughput of transportation system. A sensitivity analysis based algorithm is also developed to solve the practical capacity model efficiently. The capacity-based network robustness index identifies the links which play critical roles in the transportation capacity of the whole network. The capacity-based network robustness index is an effective supplementary to the existing network evaluation indices. The experiments demonstrate the differences between the capacity-based network robustness index and the efficiency-based network robustness index. The capacity-based network robustness index can be used as a practical measure in the situations where the network robustness index is not significant.},

abstract = {In order to create an injection-molded battery clip for the Chibitronics Circuit Sticker kit, both manufacturing and product design principles were considered to inform product feel and form as well as ensure manufacturability in future iterations of the clip. Prototypes were initially designed using modeling clay. These prototypes were then developed in Solidworks and printed on a MakerBot 3D printer. Three iterations of prototypes were tested and design decisions were made based on user need and aesthetic appeal of the battery clips. These prototypes were used to determine a final design decisions and the creation of a mold that will be used in future manufacturing of these battery clips.},

    abstract = { Some confusion seems to have developed over the relationship between accessibility and travel patterns. Various concepts of attraction, accessibility, and potential are examined with the object of reaching a more satisfactory definition. Multivariate analysis of data relating to an urban area suggests that the influences of conventional accessibility indices are concealed by collinear socioeconomic variations; when these are separated there is a more pronounced relationship. It is shown that such a relationship has important consequences for urban planning. }
