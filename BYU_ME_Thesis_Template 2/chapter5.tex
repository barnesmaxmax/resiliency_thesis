\section{Overview}

This chapter summarizes the recommendations resulting from the resiliency
model application, it also contains information about obtaining the model and
outlines next steps.

\section{Problem and Objective}

UDOT is responsible for maintaining a
transportation system to promote public welfare and economic activity throughout
the state of Utah. UDOT is also responsible to maintain key components of the
national highway transportation system. Given the importance of this system,
UDOT has sought a way to identify those facilities which are most critical to
overall systemic function. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the relative systemic
criticality of highway links on a statewide network using a logit-based model
sensitive to changes in route path, destination choice, and mode choice.

The development of the presented model directly addresses the objective of
this study. The mdoel is logit-based, and incorporates a users
ability to choose a mode and destination, while still being sensitive to route
path in terms of time and distance. Using the logsum, which captures the total
value of the available choice set, different estimates were provided compared to
other traditional methods such as the travel time method. The ability that the
presented model gives UDOT to quickly analyze any highway link on USTM, and return a
cost estimate, is highly advantageous. The model allows UDOT to determine
the relative systemic criticality of highway links on the network.

\section{Recommendations}

The USTM model is a gravity-based travel demand model, while the Resiliency
Model is logit-based. The logit-based nature of the model allows
greater sensitivity towards user mode and destination choice to exist, which causes
the estimated costs associated with link closure to be different using the presented model. The Resiliency
Model's incorporation of both the logsum for HBW, HBO, and NHB purposes, as
well as the travel time calculation for the other purposes included in USTM,
provide important functionality towards estimating more realistic, conservative costs
associated with long term highway closure.

Logit-based modeling returns more conservative, different,
estimations of the criticality of a link to a network. This is a highly
important adaptation to USTM because alternative estimation methods which produce
different estimations allow
UDOT to better understand the monetary and systemic importance of highway links
throughout Utah. Additionally, the model’s design allows for further
analysis of additional link closure, eased identification of critical
points on Utah's highway network, and even multi-link closure in the
future. Thus, it is recommended that USTM have a logit-based mode and destination
choice model in the future. Logit-based mode and destination choice models have
become standard practice in other states, and enables better understanding of
human behavior. Additionally, UDOT should consider behavior in its resiliency
analysis. Road users do change modes, destinations, and routes when a network
suddenly becomes altered. These decisions do result in different criticality
priority rankings as shown through the logsum and travel time rankings in this study.
UDOT should also consider development of a better regional freight model.

\section{Limitations and Next Steps}

Implementation of a logit-based travel demand model is highly important for
resource allocation moving into the future. Updating USTM to include a
logit-based trip distribution model instead of a gravity-based model would
improve the flexibility of travel demand estimates moving forward.

The decision to not include a feedback loop, which iteratively runs the model
until the specifications of a convergence factor are met. Incorporating a
feedback loop would have allowed for more accurate estimation of increased
travel times and more accurate route choices between OD pairs in the final
iteration of the model compared with the first iteration.
This decision introduces limitations on the
ability of the model to accurately estimate the effects of link closure on
travel time. This limits the ability of the model to estimate accurate changes in
response to increased travel time due to congestion because cannot be
accurately measured after one iteration.

Adding a congestion feedback loop to the model would allow more
accurate cost estimations to be made. A feedback loop would cause the
travel time and logsum information to be fed back into the beginning of the
model and rerun continuously until the specifications of a convergence
parameter were met. The loop would allow for better estimates of the change
in travel time due to both route change and resulting congestion. The loop
also allows for more accurate route choice, mode choice, and destination
choice to be made when the true effects of congestion are accounted for.
In June 2020, the UDOT Technical Advisory Committee decided to not include a
feedback loop to save time
on model development for this study. A feedback loop and sensitivity analysis
should be included as part of future work.

Another limitation in the presented model is that all HBW trips are flexible in
destination choice, meaning that a user could choose to work in a different
TAZ than that in which their actual place of employment is located. This is
not entirely logical, considering that most workplace locations are fixed. Additionally,
with the recent turn towards telecommuting, workplace location flexibility is
likely more common. A method for estimating HBW trips and the associated dis-benefit
while accounting for both flexibility and inflexibility should be developed.

It is not unreasonable to assume that in the event of an earthquake or
similar widespread disaster event, that multiple links could become
damaged. An important use of the presented model in future research would be
to analyze the results of simultaneous multiple link
loss. This will allow for
greater understanding of the effects that adverse events can have on Utah’s
highway network, and help UDOT to better prepare for the development and
maintenance needs of the future. Developing a fully functioning transit oriented logit model
would be highly advantageous to the Utah Transit Authority as well. The capability
is already incorporated into the structure of the model, however, a few modifications
need to be made in order for it to become fully functioning.
Additionally, the development of logsum calculations for trips with fixed
origins and destinations should also be considered. This model, however,
would be very different than the presented model because freight trips
do not typically have a mode or destination choice option, so it would be
more prudent to incorporate a method to account for other choices such as travel time,
distance or even elevation change on a given route. Driver awareness of physical
conditions of the highway n network would also play a role in how a Freight trip
is routed on a highway network. One option to overcome this limitation, is to use the national
freight network, which would allow freight trips to divert through other Interstate
facilites.

Another limitation present in the travel time method of analysis is that passenger
trips occurring between internal-external or external-internal nodes were not
included. These trips likely do not make up a large portion of trips on the network,
however, this may still affect the ability of the travel time method of comparison
to make estimations that reflect all trips on the network. Additionally

\section{Summary}

The development of a logit-based travel demand model can improve the way UDOT
estimates costs associated with link loss experienced by Utahns when compared
with traditional modeling methods. The presented model provides a different cost
estimate than does the travel time methodology created as a method of comparison
in this thesis. Logit-based models possess unique properties which allow modelers
to incorporate multiple types of data. With this ability in mind, the Resiliency
Model includes several types of available data deemed pertinent to
constructing a working logit-based model in Utah. The presented model's
logsum estimations, which account for user choice were calculated, and can help
professionals better evaluate risk to Utah's infrastructure by identifying
critical facilities. User choice is a highly important consideration in modern modeling practice because it accounts for user choice while estimating
network trips. The model generates valuable results that should
be used to prioritize link importance to the overall functionality of Utah's
highway network. There are several important implications that follow the
results.

First, purely
using change in travel time or travel time delay as the main dis-benefit measure may not
be entirely accurate in most situations. This is due to the difficulty of finding
available data for all trip purposes included in USTM. Second, allowing users in the model
to choose both a mode and destination increases the resemblance of a real life
decision making process, especially given adverse circumstance on Utah's
highway network. Importantly, the presented model is able to provide results measured
using two different methods of cost estimation, first the logsum and second the travel time difference,
allowing different priorities to be evaluated from the model's results.
It is evident that the presented model brings several
modeling estimation advantages to the forefront, something which must be
explored further in future research. The biggest contribution of this study to
the field of transportation modeling is the incorporation of a logit-based model
into a statewide highway network. Applying a logsum to a network as large as USTM, and
estimating the dis-benefit associated with link closure, provide the basis for both
UDOT and other state transportation agencies to be able to quickly estimate
the criticality of any single link or combination of links to overall systemic
resiliency of a highway network while accounting for route change, mode choice, and destination choice.
