\section{Problem Statement}
The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is responsible for maintaining a
transportation system to promote public welfare and economic activity throughout
the state of Utah. UDOT is also responsible to maintain key components of the
national highway transportation system. Given the importance of this system,
UDOT has sought a way to identify those facilities which are critical to smooth
operation of the system.

In 2017, \citet{aem2017} completed a risk and resilience analysis report for the I-15 corridor on behalf of
UDOT. This analysis quantified risk as the probability of threats (earthquakes, floods, fires,
etc.) multiplied by the criticality of the asset to the overall system. The AEM
analysis has two primary limitations. First, the methods are proprietary to
AEM and UDOT cannot now apply the methods to study the criticality of other transportation
corridors with regional and national significance (e.g. U.S. Route 6, Interstate 70, Interstate 80). But more
importantly, the current index treats each UDOT asset – each bridge, highway segment, etc. – as an
independent unit, when in fact UDOT operates a system of interrelated transportation facilities. The criticality
of a single bridge to the overall system is not determined by the volume of traffic it supports
directly, but by how inconvenient it would be for that traffic to find another path or destination
were the bridge to fail. Resiliency must therefore be considered a function of network, mode, and destination
alternatives which comprise systemic redundancy. Developing a model capable of accounting for the choices a user makes will help
transportation planners to calculate sensitive estimates of the costs associated with link closure.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objective of this research is to develop a methodology and tool to evaluate the
network redundancy of critical UDOT assets across the state. We base this tool on data collected
for the Utah Statewide Travel Model (USTM), with certain improvements and additional model
features to more accurately capture the economic costs associated with an impaired state highway
network. In particular, we develop a method that explicitly considers the availability of
alternative destinations, modes, and routes to individuals traveling on the impaired network. A
secondary objective of this research is to apply the model to evaluate the criticality of
specific
highway links in Utah by comparison. This thesis presents the results of this evaluation applied
on 41 individual highway links.

\section{Scope}
The purpose of this thesis is to provide a functional tool that can be used to evaluate
the potential economic costs associated with highway link closure in Utah. USTM comprises
the entire highway network, with roughly 8500 Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ),
with a population of about 3.2 million people.
Developing a choice model (hereby named the Resiliency Model) can help to determine
the effects of road closures or long term link loss for the entire State of Utah.
Therefore, the Resiliency Model is based on the theory of logit choice modeling and
shortest path finding in a network. The specific choice utility equations in the model represent
a plausible utility outcome, but the focus of this research has not been on developing robust
utility equations or calibrated volume-delay functions. This model is therefore not designed to
forecast traffic volumes nor is it designed for any purpose other than providing a comparative estimate
of the effects of link loss by man-made or natural causes.
