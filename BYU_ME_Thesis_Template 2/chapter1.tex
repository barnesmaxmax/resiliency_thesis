\section{Problem Statement}
The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is responsible for maintaining a
transportation system to promote public welfare and economic activity throughout
the state of Utah. UDOT is also responsible to maintain key components of the
national highway transportation system. Given the importance of this system,
UDOT has sought a way to identify those facilities which are most critical to smooth
operation of the system.

In 2017, \citet{aem2017} completed a risk and resilience analysis report for the I-15 corridor on behalf of
UDOT. This analysis quantified risk as the probability of threats (earthquakes, floods, fires,
etc.) multiplied by the criticality of the asset to the overall system. The AEM
analysis has two primary limitations. First, the methods are proprietary to
\citet{aem2017} such that UDOT cannot now apply the methods to study the criticality of other transportation
corridors with regional and national significance (e.g., U.S. Route 6, I-70, I-80). But more
importantly, the current index treats each UDOT asset – each bridge, highway segment, etc. – as an
independent unit, when in fact UDOT operates a system of interrelated transportation facilities. The criticality
of a single bridge to the overall system is not determined by the volume of traffic it supports
directly, but by how inconvenient it would be for that traffic to find another path or destination,
were the bridge to fail. Therefore, a resilient network must be considered a function of
available mode and destination alternatives. Developing a model capable of accounting for the choices a user makes will help
transportation planners to calculate sensitive estimates of the costs associated with link closure.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology and tool to evaluate the
relative systemic criticality of highway links on a statewide network using a model
sensitive to changes in route path, destination choice, and mode choice.
This tool is based on data collected
from the Utah Statewide Travel Model (USTM), with certain improvements and additional model
features to more accurately capture the economic costs associated with an impaired state highway
network. In particular, we develop a method that explicitly considers the availability of
alternative destinations, modes, and routes to individuals traveling on the impaired network. A
secondary objective of this research is to apply the model to evaluate the criticality of
specific
highway links in Utah, by comparing the change in accessibility, or dis-benefit,
experienced by road users.
This thesis presents the results of this evaluation applied
on 40 individual highway links.

\section{Scope}
The purpose of this thesis is to provide a functional tool to evaluate the
relative systemic criticality of highway links on a statewide network using a model
sensitive to changes in route path, destination choice, and mode choice.
The effects of these changes caused by link closure can be measured as potential
economic costs associated with highway link closure in Utah. USTM comprises
the entire highway network in Utah, with about 75,000 links, 36,000 nodes and 8,500 Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ).
Additionally, USTM covers the geographic area in which about 3.2 million people live.
Developing a choice model such as the one presented in this study can help to determine
the effects of road closures or long term link loss for the entire State of Utah.
To better determine these effects, the presented model is based on the theory of logit choice modeling and
shortest path finding in a network. The specific choice utility equations in the model represent
a plausible utility outcome, but the focus of this research has not been on developing robust
utility equations or calibrated volume-delay functions. This model is therefore not designed to
forecast traffic volumes nor is it designed for any purpose other than providing a comparative estimate
of the effects of link loss by man-made or natural causes.
